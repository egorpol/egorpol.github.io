# Hello everyone,

Iâ€™m excited to finally carve out some time to make my first post here, and I hope to keep the updates coming! ðŸ˜›

Iâ€™ve just rolled out an update to a tool I developed several months ago. Originally designed for parsing Wikipedia and IMSLP to find composers whose works are in the public domain within the EU, it now boasts some significant enhancements.

## New Features and Improvements

- **PublicDomainSheetMusicFinder.ipynb**: Code optimization and refactoring for improved performance and readability.
- **imslp_extract.ipynb**: Newly added notebook to parse all available scores for a selected composer from the IMSLP database.
- **llm_parse.ipynb**: Experimental notebook for parsing, summarizing, and answering questions about a selected composer based on their Wikipedia article. This notebook utilizes local running large language models provided in LM Studio.

For those interested in exploring these updates, the updated project is available on my GitHub: [PublicDomainSheetMusicFinder](https://github.com/egorpol/PublicDomainSheetMusicFinder)

Stay tuned for more updates!
