## About Me

Ukraine-born composer and researcher specializing in human-computer interactions in music. Currently pursuing post-doctoral research at HMT Leipzig, Germany. Proud father of two.

## Research Focus

My research explores analytical and practical aspects of human-computer interactions in music. Over the course of my music career, my focus has evolved through the following stages:

- Performing (cello and piano)
- Composing
- Composing with electroacoustic media
- Performing with electroacoustic media
- Analyzing and understanding music with computers
- Incorporating Python and machine learning into creative and analytical music processes

## Academic Background

- **2013‚Äì2018:** Doctorate in Musicology (Dr. phil.), HMT Leipzig
  - Dissertation: "Computer-Based Analysis and Visual Representations of Music in the Context of the Latest Developments in Computer/Multimedia and Their Integration into Musicological Research and Teaching"
  - Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Gesine Schr√∂der (HMT Leipzig) and Prof. Dr. Martin Supper (UdK Berlin)
- **2011‚Äì2014:** Master's in Composition, State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart
  - Under Prof. Marco Stroppa
- **2010‚Äì2013:** Meisterklasse in Electroacoustics, HMT Leipzig
  - Under Prof. Ipke Starke
- **2004‚Äì2010:** Diploma in Composition, HMT Leipzig
  - Under Prof. Peter Herrmann and Prof. Ipke Starke

## Current Position

Since 2013, I have been serving as an Artistic Associate and Researcher at HMT Leipzig. My responsibilities include:

- Leading seminars in electroacoustics and musicology
- Providing artistic and technical supervision for student projects involving live electronics and audiovisual media in electroacoustic and composition courses

## Current Projects

1. **CAMAT:** A Python-based symbolic music toolbox
   - Collaboration with Martin Pfleiderer at HfM Weimar

## Latest Updates

I recently attended the InMusic24 conference ([https://www.inmusicconference.com/](https://www.inmusicconference.com/)) in Oslo, and it was a blast! I met many wonderful people and presented my project on ML-based sound generation approaches (‚ÄúExploration of Timbre by Analysis and Synthesis‚Äù using Python, Ableton, and ChatGPT). The project employs various global optimization algorithms with the primary goal of synthesizing a DFT frame within a restricted FM/AM setup, optionally aimed for use within Ableton/Operator.

You can check the corresponding repository with PowerPoint slides and accompanying Jupyter notebooks: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/egorpol/audiospylt/tree/main/exploration_of_timbre).

**Note on Name Change:** Due to a change in my documents, my last name has been transliterated from "Poliakov" to "Polyakov" (while staying the same in Cyrillic). I am now using "Polyakov" consistently, so several publications and mentions may be inconsistent. Let's hope for no more changes in the future! üòä
